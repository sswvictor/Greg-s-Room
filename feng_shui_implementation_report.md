# Feng Shui Chi Implementation Report

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a feng shui-based Chi scoring system for Greg's Room. This system evaluates furniture placement based on traditional feng shui principles and provides feedback to the player. The implementation follows a modular, data-driven approach that allows for easy editing and expansion of feng shui rules.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Core Data Structures
- **FengShuiRulesData.cs**: ScriptableObject that stores all feng shui rules
- **PositionType enum**: Defines positions within a room (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, Center)
- **ZoneQuality enum**: Defines quality of placement (Excellent, Acceptable, Poor)
- **PositionRule class**: Defines rules for specific positions with scores and feedback
- **DirectionalRule class**: Groups position rules by furniture orientation
- **FengShuiRuleSet class**: Complete rule set for an object type in a specific room

### 2. Position Mapping System
- **PositionMapper.cs**: Maps world positions to feng shui grid positions
- Implements a 3x3 grid system for basic positions (N, NE, E, etc.)
- Detects special positions like "near wall", "near door", etc.

### 3. Visualization System
- **FengShuiVisualizer.cs**: Shows colored placement zones during furniture dragging
- Dynamically updates based on furniture orientation
- Uses green/white/red colors to indicate excellent/acceptable/poor placement

### 4. Score Calculation
- Enhanced **CHIScoreManager.cs** to incorporate feng shui rules
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing base score system
- Evaluates furniture placement based on position and orientation
- Provides detailed feedback messages based on placement quality

### 5. Room Integration
- Updated **RoomManager.cs** to support room type identification
- Room types determine which feng shui rules apply
- Each room can have different rules for the same furniture

### 6. Editor Tooling
- **FengShuiRuleEditor.cs**: Custom editor window for editing feng shui rules
- Allows designers to create and edit rules without coding
- Supports creating multiple rule sets for different rooms and furniture

## Testing Steps

1. **Verify Room Types**:
   - Check each room in RoomManager has a roomType set (e.g., "Bedroom", "LivingRoom")

2. **Test Base Placement**:
   - Place furniture and verify base scores still work
   - Check that CHI bar updates properly

3. **Test Feng Shui Visualization**:
   - Drag furniture and verify colored zones appear
   - Rotate furniture and verify zones update

4. **Test Feedback Messages**:
   - Place furniture in different zones and check feedback messages
   - Verify messages match the configured rules

5. **Test Score Modifiers**:
   - Place furniture in excellent/poor zones and verify scores change
   - Check total CHI score reflects the modifiers

## Usage Instructions

### For Designers

1. **Editing Feng Shui Rules**:
   - Open the Feng Shui Rule Editor from the menu: Greg's Room > Feng Shui Rule Editor
   - Create a new rule set or edit existing ones
   - Define rules for each furniture type and orientation

2. **Setting Room Types**:
   - In RoomManager, set the roomType field for each RoomData
   - Make sure rule sets match the room types in your scene

### For Programmers

1. **Adding New Features**:
   - Extend PositionMapper for more complex position mapping
   - Add special relationship checks (e.g., bed near plant)
   - Implement rule inheritance between room types

2. **Debugging**:
   - Check console for [FENG SHUI] tagged messages
   - Feng shui zones show placement quality visually
   - Review feedback messages for rule verification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Relationship Rules**:
   - Add rules for relationships between furniture (e.g., "bed should not face door")
   - Implement proximity checks between specific furniture types

2. **Advanced Visualization**:
   - Add visual indicators for "head" and "tail" of furniture
   - Show recommended rotation options

3. **Rule Expansion**:
   - Add more detailed rules for each room type
   - Implement seasonal variations in feng shui rules

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Pool visualization objects instead of creating/destroying
   - Cache calculations where possible

## Conclusion

The feng shui Chi system provides a solid foundation for evaluating furniture placement based on traditional principles. The modular, data-driven approach allows for easy expansion and customization of rules without modifying code. The visual feedback system helps players understand proper placement, enhancing the gameplay experience.
