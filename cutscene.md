# Parallax Cutscene System Implementation Plan

## MVP Goals

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Implement smooth transitions between rooms using parallax effects
   - Create a basic cutscene director system to manage transitions
   - Integrate with existing RoomManager system
   - Support basic camera movement and timing control

2. **Visual Requirements**
   - Support multiple parallax layers (foreground, midground, background)
   - Enable smooth layer movement at different speeds
   - Maintain consistent art style with current voxel aesthetic
   - Implement fade transitions for seamless room changes

## Technical Requirements

1. **RoomData Extension**
   ```csharp
   public class RoomData {
       public GameObject roomPrefab;
       public List<GameObject> buttonPrefabs;
       // New fields for cutscene support
       public bool hasCutscene;
       public CutsceneData entranceCutscene;
       public CutsceneData exitCutscene;
   }

   public class CutsceneData {
       public List<ParallaxLayer> layers;
       public float duration;
       public CameraMovementData cameraData;
   }
   ```

2. **System Integration Points**
   - Hook into RoomManager's transition system
   - Extend WallVisibilityController for cutscene compatibility
   - Integrate with existing camera system
   - Maintain CHI score display during transitions

## Implementation Blocks

### Block 1: Core Systems Setup
1. **CutsceneDirector Component**
   - Manage cutscene state and timing
   - Control layer movements
   - Handle camera transitions
   - Coordinate with RoomManager

2. **ParallaxLayer System**
   - Layer movement controls
   - Speed and depth management
   - Sprite/object positioning
   - Layer visibility control

### Block 2: Room Integration
1. **RoomManager Extensions**
   - Add cutscene trigger points
   - Implement cutscene state handling
   - Manage transition timing
   - Update room loading process

2. **Camera System Updates**
   - Add cutscene camera support
   - Implement smooth camera movements
   - Handle perspective transitions
   - Maintain orthographic consistency

### Block 3: Visual Implementation
1. **Asset Requirements**
   - Parallax layer prefabs
   - Transition effects
   - Background elements
   - Foreground decorations

2. **Animation System**
   - Layer movement animations
   - Camera path definitions
   - Timing controls
   - Easing functions

## Future Iterations

1. **Enhanced Features**
   - Interactive elements during cutscenes
   - Dynamic camera paths
   - Event trigger system
   - Custom particle effects

2. **Content Creation**
   - Additional transition variations
   - Room-specific cutscenes
   - Special event sequences
   - Achievement celebrations

## Technical Considerations

1. **Performance**
   - Object pooling for layer elements
   - Efficient sprite management
   - Memory optimization
   - Draw call optimization

2. **Compatibility**
   - Maintain existing room functionality
   - Support save/load system
   - Handle edge cases
   - Error recovery

## Success Criteria

1. **Core Requirements**
   - Smooth transitions between all rooms
   - No frame rate drops during cutscenes
   - Consistent visual quality
   - Seamless integration with existing systems

2. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive flow between rooms
   - Engaging visual transitions
   - Maintained game feel
   - No jarring camera movements
